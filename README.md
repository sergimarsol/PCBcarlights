## Introduction

Modern cars rely on sophisticated lighting systems for safety and aesthetics. The PCB Car Lights project aims to streamline the control of car lights, providing a compact and efficient solution through a custom-designed PCB.

## Features

- **Efficient Control:** Optimal management of car lights for improved energy efficiency.

## Getting Started

To get started with the PCB Car Lights project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/PCBcarlights.git
   ```

2. **Explore the Documentation:**
   Review the documentation files, including the README, to understand the project structure and requirements.

3. **Set Up Development Environment:**
   Ensure you have the necessary tools and software installed for PCB design. Refer to the documentation for specific requirements.

4. **Modify Design:**
   Customize the PCB design according to your car's lighting specifications, making any necessary adjustments to the schematic and layout.

5. **Testing:**
   Before manufacturing the PCB, simulate and test the design using appropriate tools to ensure functionality.

## Schematic and Layout

The schematic diagram provides an overview of the electronic components and their connections and the PCB layout file defines the physical arrangement of components on the board. Open both files using [Kicad] to view the schematic and the layout of the implemented PCB. Screenshots of both files and of the block diagram are also provided:
