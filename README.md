## Introduction

Modern cars rely on sophisticated lighting systems for safety and aesthetics. The PCB Car Lights project aims to streamline the control of car lights, providing a compact and efficient solution through a custom-designed PCB.

## Features

- **Efficient Control:** Optimal management of car lights for improved energy efficiency.
- **Customizable Design:** Adapt the PCB to fit various car models and lighting configurations.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple and intuitive controls for easy integration into existing car systems.

## Getting Started

To get started with the PCB Car Lights project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/PCBcarlights.git
   ```

2. **Explore the Documentation:**
   Review the documentation files, including the README, to understand the project structure and requirements.

3. **Set Up Development Environment:**
   Ensure you have the necessary tools and software installed for PCB design. Refer to the documentation for specific requirements.
